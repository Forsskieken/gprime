It doesn't require a \"server\" (but can run on one). When you start gPrime, you interact with it via your webbrowser. There are no more Gtk (the GUI that Gramps uses) issues, because it doesn't use Gtk. It's like the Narrative Web Report [3] from Gramps, but it is interactive---you'll be able to edit/add/delete data and run reports.\r\n* Python-based: it uses the same objects and Python libraries as Gramps. gPrime libraries are also designed to be useful outside of gPrime, and is of course [open source](https://github.com/GenealogyCollective/gprime)\r\n* Fast and Flexible: gPrime does away with the convoluted and hard to use Gramps Filters and replaces those with a new flexible search system. It works more like using a search engine than using Gramps' filters. And it talks directly to the database engine rather than sequentially scanning the database (as Gramps' current filter system works). gPrime is designed to be fast on large and very large trees. \r\n* Modern and Collaborative: gPrime allows multiusers and is planned to be integrated with tools to make collaboration easier (messages, research notes, email, etc) and to be easily connected to other genealogy websites, and take advantage of modern Javascript libraries. Also, gPrime is designed to facilitate merge and splits, and manage database changes.\r\n\r\nCurrently, you can browse all of your Gramps data. The goal is to have a complete working system by July 2017.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to make genealogy more interesting, friendly, powerful, open, easy, and inviting for a diverse group of users, please consider joining our Board of Advisors:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhxC0mnVtweau0snweFW5-2Td8I9Wj-sCXpokeVT7EBLAypw/viewform\r\n",
