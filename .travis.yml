sudo: required
dist: trusty
language: python
python:
 - 3.3 # This is irrelevant, because the virtualenv is not used at all

# FIXME: The minimum requirement for Gprime is Python 3.2, so a test environment
# for Python 3.2 should be added to this environment which is Python 3.3. It
# will not be possible to run coverage under Python 3.2, because coverage is
# Python 3.3 (or above) only.

before_install:

install:
# The working directory is set to /home/travis/build/genealogycollective/gprime
# by the automatic git checkout.

# Download Sean Ross-Ross's Pure Python module containing a framework to
# manipulate and analyze python astï¿½s and bytecode. This is loaded to 
# /home/travis/build/genealogycollective/gprime/meta
# FIXME: This should be loaded from the release directory at
# https://pypi.python.org/pypi/meta
 - git clone -b master https://github.com/srossross/meta

# Build Gprime package. This seems to copy everything to
# /home/travis/build/scripts-3.3
 - python setup.py build

before_script:
# Create the Gprime database directory.
 - mkdir -p ~/.gprime/grampsdb/
# set PYTHONPATH so the directly installed module (meta) is picked up from
# /home/travis/build/genalogycollective/gprime/meta
 - export PYTHONPATH=meta
# set module exclusions. --exclude=TestUser because of older version of mock
# without configure_mock
 - export EXCLUDE="--exclude=TestcaseGenerator --exclude=vcard
   --exclude=merge_ref_test --exclude=user_test"
# set GPRIME_RESOURCES for locale, data,image and documentation
 - export GPRIME_RESOURCES=.

script:
# Ignore the virtualenv entirely. Use nosetests3, python3 (3.4.0) and coverage
# from /usr/bin. Use libraries from /usr/lib/python3.4,
# /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages and /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
 - nosetests3 --nologcapture --with-coverage --cover-package=gprime $EXCLUDE
   gprime  test test/GrampsLogger
# FIXME: This should have run from the current directory, rather than from
# gprime, because there is some test code in that directory.

# give an error for any trailing whitespace
 - if git --no-pager grep --color -n --full-name '[ 	]$' -- \*.py; then
     echo "ERROR - Trailing whitespace found in source file(s)";
     exit 1;
   fi

after_success:
# apt-get installs python3-coverage, but codecov only invokes coverage, so make
# a link
 - sudo ln /usr/bin/python3-coverage /usr/bin/coverage

# We have to use the bash script because the apt-get coverage does not install
# codecov. If we used pip to install codecov, it would run inside the
# virtualenv, and that doesn't work. Change the path to ensure that codecov
# picks up coverage from /usr/bin, rather than from
# /home/travis/virtualenv/python3.3.6/bin/
